[[NEW! SLASH COMMANDS]]
`interaction.reply()` can only be used once per interaction
  you can check if it's been used via bool `interaction.replied` <-- this doesn't work
`interaction.followUp()` for use after reply has been used, can be used many times
`interaction.channel.send()` will send to channel without replying to the user

`{ephemeral: true}` means it's only shown to the user who triggered the command
  usually used for error scenarios
